00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.440
<v ->Let's talk about the three types of communication</v>

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.170
and how you can use them most effectively.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.900
The first type of communication is verbal.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.060
Verbal messages are spoken out loud and heard by others.

5
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.640
Examples include phone calls and in-person conversations.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.480
With verbal communication, you'll want to:

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.540
One, speak slowly and confidently.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.280
Remember, this is your message,

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.220
make sure it's heard.

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.750
Two, stay on topic.

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.070
By staying on track,

12
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.410
you'll help to make sure your listeners leave

13
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.580
with the right take-away.

14
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.650
And, three, pay attention to the tone of your voice.

15
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.270
Your meaning will change depending

16
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.610
on your volume, inflection and sound.

17
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.823
Do your best to make sure your tone matches your message.

18
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.680
The second type of communication is nonverbal.

19
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.670
Nonverbal messages are wordless and seen by others.

20
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.760
Examples include your body language

21
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.690
and facial expressions.

22
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.320
With nonverbal communication,

23
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.120
you'll wanna be aware of your nonverbal cues.

24
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.320
It can be easy to forget about our nonverbal cues.

25
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.900
Make sure your facial expressions

26
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.930
and body language align with your intentions.

27
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.760
That way, you're less likely to give the wrong impression.

28
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.180
You'll also wanna pair your gestures with words.

29
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.930
That will help prevent ambiguity

30
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.710
and keep your message extra clear.

31
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.120
Finally, practice open, friendly body language.

32
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.980
That will help to show attentiveness,

33
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.370
interest and confidence.

34
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.040
The third type of communication is written.

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.730
Written messages are text-base and read by others.

36
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.820
Examples include emails and letters.

37
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310
With written communication,

38
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.230
you'll want to plan before you write.

39
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.100
That will help keep your writing structured

40
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.280
and easy to follow.

41
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.130
You also will wanna keep your message clear and concise.

42
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.920
Your receiver should be able to quickly understand

43
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.420
why you're sending this message.

44
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.720
Finally, make sure you use proper grammar,

45
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.660
spelling and punctuation.

46
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.330
If you don't proofread your work,

47
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.250
you could ruin the credibility of your written message.

48
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.800
Follow these tips for effective verbal,

49
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.290
nonverbal and written communication

50
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.040
and it's more likely your messages

51
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.413
will be heard, seen and read.
